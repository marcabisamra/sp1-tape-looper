# Changelog

All notable changes to the SP-1 Tape Looper.
Versions 1.0.0-1.2.4 below were the 2.0 development line (developed as a
fork by marc, never announced) — kept for the honest record. The classic
4-song firmware lives on the `v1` branch. Base: 1.x at commit c60941c.

## [3.0.0] - stereo, fx, and much more

**Back up first. 3.0 changes the storage format.** Use *Download all* on the
transfer site before you flash. The first boot formats the card. Every song on
it is gone. Songs recorded on 3.0 survive later 3.x flashes.

### Sound
- **Stereo.** Takes record in stereo. Playback is stereo.
- **Mono or stereo per take.** Page 8: tap a track to set its next take.
- **Speed range 0.25× to 1.5×.** Pitch follows speed, as before.
- **The dropouts at max speed are gone.** Four tracks at 1.5× with USB audio in plays clean. The one edge left: heavy effect stacks at that corner can still drop out.

### Effects — eight pages
- **Open a page:** hold FN + a track button ~0.4 s. The faders become that page's controls. Tap FN to close. FN + VOL−/VOL+ steps through all eight pages.
- **Page 1 FX:** filter, chorus, distortion, trance gate.
- **Page 2 FX:** bitcrush, ring mod, auto-wah, echo.
- **Page 3 FX:** phaser, sweep, tremolo, reverb.
- **Page 4 TAPE:** drive, tone, hiss / vinyl crackle, wobble.
- **Page 5 EQ:** four bands on the whole mix.
- **Page 6 PLACE:** stereo placement per track, saved with the song.
- **Page 7 TAKE & TIMING:** downbeat offset, next take's length in bars, and a per-track nudge (hold the track button, move its fader).
- **Page 8 MODE:** mono / stereo for each track's next take.
- **Taps on a page are resets.** FN + T1 + T4 resets every page.
- **Second controls.** Hold a track button and move its fader: wah resonance, echo feedback, tremolo shape and spread, reverb damping.
- **Tap a rate.** Hold FN and tap a lane's button in time. That lane follows your taps instead of the grid.
- **Routing.** PLAY + VOL− = effects on the input (takes record with them). PLAY + VOL+ = effects on the tracks only. PLAY + double-click VOL = the whole mix.
- **Monitor mute.** FN + both VOL on a page.

### Bounce
- **Tape copy.** Hold PLAY, tap a track: the mix records into it at the speed you hear. Tap again to stop.
- **Sampler print.** Hold PLAY, hold a track: records while you hold, baked to play back at 1×.

### Playing
- **Record = hold an empty track.** Release; it is armed. Capture starts on the first sound. Tap it to stop.
- **Delete = tap a track, then press again and hold ~0.4 s.** A double-tap no longer deletes.
- **Reverse a track.** Hold FN + the track, tap PLAY. Works in every mode.
- **Isolate.** Hold FN + PLAY, press a track: a momentary solo.
- **Octave up / down.** Hold FN + PLAY, click the rocker.
- **Chop reset / home.** FN + PLAY + VOL− resets the window. FN + PLAY + VOL+ moves it home.
- **The chop window reaches one block.**

### Timing
- **The grid stays on the loops.** The beat lights and the MIDI clock no longer drift off the audio over minutes. A pause keeps the beat phase.
- **Tap tempo retunes against the loops' native tempo.** A fifth tap no longer undoes the fourth. A rocker move no longer skews the next tap run.
- **Preset take length.** Set bars on page 7. The take stops itself on the grid.

### Lights
- **VU meter** on the side row while playing.
- **Page lights.** Each lane shows its depth. Page 7 shows the beat chase.
- **Hardware PWM.** The LEDs no longer cost CPU.

### Not fixed
- A bounce at the full corner (three stereo tracks at 1.5× with USB audio in) can overrun. Bounce at 1× when it matters.

### Transfer site (ships with this firmware)
- Reads and writes the 3.0 format: stereo WAV in and out, mono and stereo takes side by side, *Download all*.

### Removed
- Heads-mode double-tap reverse (use FN + track, then PLAY).
- The FN + rocker double-click chop reset (use FN + PLAY + VOL−). Every FN + rocker click now halves or doubles.


## [2.7.2] - the dropout fix

- **USB streaming: no more dropouts at normal speeds.** USB traffic
  made each storage read take twice as long. Now the tape streamer
  gets priority when a loop runs low. It steps back when the loop
  recovers. Buttons stay responsive.
- **Max speed while streaming: much better.** Dropouts
  are rare now. Max speed without streaming is clean.
- **Heads mode: double-tap reverses the source track.** Before, the
  other heads reversed and the source did not. Bug since v2.3.0.
- **No more short silence when you let go of FUNCTION after a window
  change.** Releasing FUNCTION after you move the window (or glide the
  chop) always caused a short gain dip. Now the dip happens only if
  you release while still moving a fader.


## [2.7.1] - instant record

No format change: songs, grids and settings survive when flashed.

### Added
- **Instant record, on by default.** But recording still keeps the same behavior
 of audio-threshold activation or right on the grid if there is one.
- **Opt for slight-hold record.** Uncheck instant record on the transfer
  site and takes keep only what comes after the short arm delay, like
  before.

### Fixed
- **Grids hold still.** The machine measured each gridded take and moved
  the grid afterward. It does not move the grid anymore. The grid you set
  is the grid you keep, until you re-tap it.

### Transfer site (ships with this firmware)
- **Play.** Listen to any track in the browser before you download or
  replace it. It loops at the song's tape speed.
- **Delete.** Remove a track from the site. Same as double-tap delete.
- **Upload many.** Select a batch of downloaded files. Each file goes to
  its song and track by name. With Download all, this is a full backup
  and restore.
- **True lengths.** Cells show the recorded audio's length, not the loop
  region. No more "56.3 s" on a two-bar take.
- **A settings panel** with the instant-record switch, and progress bars
  in a sticky activity log.

## [2.7.0] - stabilization

We measured the button ladder on hardware, all sixteen
states. That explained mutes that missed, low end that vanished, and song
jumps that nobody asked for. Flash reads also got 20% cheaper. Dropouts with 4 tracks at high speeds are still an issue 
with audio feeding in over USB (no dropouts if audio input is paused)
The full fix needs a storage change for CPU optimization which will ship with 3.0.

### Small Optimizations
- **Fewer dropouts.** Each 512-byte flash read gets a CRC check, and that
  check ran one byte at a time. It was 42% of the read path. The CRC now
  folds four bytes per pass.
- **A muted track stops reading from flash during a take.** That bandwidth
  goes to what you can hear.

### Added
- **Mute any set of tracks at once.** The four track buttons share one
  analog pin. A multi-button press makes its own voltage, and most of those
  voltages had no meaning in the decode table. All sixteen states are
  measured and mapped now. Tap the other three tracks to solo one. This was
  filed as a hardware limit for months. It was a table.
- **Track 1 + Track 4 is two gestures.** A quick press mutes tracks 1 and 4.
  A 3 s hold enters the bootloader. Only exactly 1+4 can arm it. 1+2+4,
  1+3+4 and all four are their own codes and can never reach it.

### Fixed
- **The high-pass no longer turns on by itself.** The FUNCTION fader layer
  engaged at 1.2% of travel. A loose fader or a hand-wobble crossed that.
  The gate is 2.7% now, still trivial to cross on purpose.
- **The window and the chop no longer edit themselves.**
- **The start/end faders no longer flip to reverse when they are only near.**
- **FUNCTION + several track buttons no longer changes the song.**
- **FUNCTION + three or four track buttons no longer counts as PLAY.**
- **The device can always power off.** A phantom song change latched the
  transport with nothing loaded. The power-off gate then refused to run.
- **Power-off no longer competes with the transport.** Holding function no longer accidently
powers off device. The tape must be stopped to power-off.
- **Tape speed survives power-off.** The speed reached the song index only
  on a song switch. Power-off now stores the live speed before the final
  flush. Found in release testing.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-08-05

One clock. v2.5.0's bench ran at 120 BPM — one of only twelve
integer tempos whose eight-beat loop lands exactly on a flash-block boundary —
so it could not see what was left. A 128.000 BPM bench found it, plus five bugs
of its own and a way to round to the nearest whole number BPM. An eight-beat take 
now comes back as **exactly 180000 samples at exactly 128.000 BPM** and stays locked 
to takes recorded minutes later. No format change: songs, grids and settings survive.

### Added

- **The grid learns the tempo from what you played.** Every gridded take leaves
  a landmark — its first onset — and the music runs at one tempo through all of
  them. Each take is measured against your *first*, so the baseline grows all
  session and the estimate sharpens. Bench: a tap of 128.24 refined to 127.985,
  converged on 128.000, then found nothing left to correct. Fixes tempo, not
  phase — the downbeat stays yours.
- **Round to a whole BPM.** Tap a tempo, hold FUNCTION about a second: the
  lights sweep, catch the beat, and the grid rounds. If the tap isn't near a
  whole number it declines and all four lights blink.

### Changed

- **Loop geometry is samples, not 512-byte blocks.** At 128 an eight-beat take
  stored 179968 against a true 180000 — 32 samples a lap, ~10.7 ms/min. Worse,
  the grid kept the *true* beat while the loop wrapped at the *stored* one, so
  they slid apart at four samples per beat and a late overdub punched where the
  grid was, not where the loop was. That was the layering complaint.
- **Window gestures no longer flush the audio.** Every edit used to drop the
  read-ahead and dip master gain to zero; the fader commits every 60 ms, so a
  sweep was a ~16 Hz tremolo with real silence under it. Reported by
  geraasmasjien and luuuciano. Continuous gestures settle once on release now;
  button presses stay instant. The window trails your hand instead of jumping.
- **A late punch is forgiven up to a third of a beat**, was a quarter.
- **One owner for the beat** — it lived in three variables written from twelve
  places, tied by a convention asserted once and never re-checked.

### Fixed

- **A later take could shove an earlier one half a beat out of time**, in one
  step, when a second recording finished. The rescale after a tempo correction
  clamped each loop to its *recorded audio* — but a gridded take is deliberately
  longer, since the stop rounds to the nearest beat and pads to the line. That
  pad was discarded. Needs a second landmark to fire, which is why take one was
  always fine.
- **The loop and the grid could land on different tempos** — 22612 against
  22504, 0.48%, walking the first take ~290 ms/min away from everything after
  it.
- **Overdubs came back at the wrong point in the loop** after a song switch or
  power-cycle: the anchor was read one line before it was loaded, so it used the
  previous song's value. First takes anchor at zero and always survived.
- **Reverse survived a rocker reset.** With the faders crossed, FUNCTION +
  rocker double-click silently un-reversed playback while the faders still said
  reverse. Reported by nervouskidz.
- **Deleting a still-flushing take switched off the late-punch rescue** for the
  session, silently.
- **MIDI clock ran fast** — the tick truncated and accumulated, ~32 ms/min.
- **The DJ filter ducked entering high-pass**, and could wrap and click on a
  loud four-track mix near its top corner.

### Known limits

- Prints and chopped windows stay block-quantized and can drift slightly over
  several minutes. Recorded takes don't. (This can be improved in the future)
- Anchors reload rounded to a block (<3 ms, once per song load, this can be improved in the future).
- Printing is slower at high tape speed: the render yields to playback.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-07-30

Timing truth. luuuciano reported that loops recorded over a track he was
mixing never quite sat on it and drifted apart from each other. A
click-track bench — 120.000 BPM over USB, recorded, exported and measured
per sample — cleared the engine (clicks landed 24000 samples apart with
zero in-loop drift) and found five separate causes. All are fixed here.
An eight-beat take now comes back as exactly 192000 samples: eight beats
to the sample, with 0.02 ms of drift across the loop. The same series
measured 7.94, 7.77, 7.02 and 6.94 beats before.

### Fixed
- **Loop lengths rounded once, not per beat.** Lengths live in whole flash
  blocks and the code rounded EACH BEAT before multiplying: at 120 BPM a
  beat is 93.75 blocks, forced to 94, so even a perfect tap recorded a loop
  that played at 119.68 — 1.33 ms per beat, compounding every lap, about
  160 ms of slide per minute. The metronome runs off the unquantized grid
  clock, which is exactly why the lights looked locked while the audio
  slid. The whole take is rounded once now, and later takes reference the
  base, so lengths track the true tempo AND stay exact multiples of each
  other.
- **A freshly tapped grid is the truth.** The first take used to re-anchor
  the song's downbeat to wherever recording happened to start, discarding
  the phase you had just tapped in against the music (bench: 21–82 ms off).
  When a grid was tapped this session, the first take now punches ON it
  like an overdub. Songs whose grid came from a first take keep the classic
  feel: your take IS the "1".
- **Stops round to the nearest beat.** First takes trimmed back past a 16%
  window, so releasing a hair early lost a whole beat — an intended 8-beat
  loop became 7 and phased against its 8-beat siblings forever. The window
  is half a beat now, matching overdubs.
- **Punch on the beat, not the bar, and schedule from the press.** The
  count-in waited up to a bar (~2 s). Worse, a 100 ms hold filter ran
  before the punch was scheduled, so pressing exactly ON the beat was the
  worst possible moment: the line had passed, and the take waited a full
  beat. Punches now key off the instant your finger lands.
- **Tap tempo is timed on the PRESS, not the release.** A tap cannot be
  classified until the button comes up, but the moment it names is the
  press — so the grid was being planted late by however long your finger
  rested on the button, tens of milliseconds and different every tap. The
  beat spacing also comes from the sample clock now instead of being
  rounded through a millisecond counter and back from BPM.
- **The estimator no longer runs forever.** `tempo_finish()` is the only
  thing that clears the onset estimator's active flag and the gridded stop
  path never called it, so since 1.0 it kept sampling through every later
  overdub for an answer nobody reads.

### Added
- **The first take teaches the tempo.** The onset estimator has run through
  every first take since 1.0; on tapped-grid songs its answer was thrown
  away. It now REFINES the tapped beat from the audio just recorded — a
  coarse pass over ~4 beats, then a fine pass over up to 24 counted with
  the coarse result as the ruler, plus a subdivision sanity check.
  Accepted only within 5% of the tap; the grid, metronome and MIDI clock
  retune with it. Human tapping is 0.2–1% off and that error is what walks
  a loop off its source — the recording knows better. Ambiguous or
  non-percussive material keeps the tapped value.
- **Pre-roll: a punch pressed late still starts on the beat.** The record
  ring sat empty whenever nothing was capturing; it now holds the input at
  all times, so the machine always remembers what it just heard. An armed
  punch takes the NEAREST grid line — press before it and it waits as
  before, press just after and the take begins on the line you passed, its
  head adopted straight out of the ring with the length, playhead and
  overdub phase anchor all backdated to match. Reach is a quarter beat,
  capped at 120 ms: half a beat was tried first and was too generous, since
  a press 250 ms after a line usually MEANT the next line, and reaching
  back made the take a beat too long. The ring fills on empty songs too, so
  the very first take of a song can reach back. Costs zero RAM — the buffer
  already existed.

### Changed
- The any-time grid clear is far easier to hit: tap FUNCTION, then press
  again and hold ~1 s (a double-tap where you hold the second press). The
  window went from 1.5 s to 3 s — the gesture was real but nearly
  impossible to land.

### Known limits
- The downbeat itself is still placed by your hand, and hands anticipate a
  beat they are following by a few tens of milliseconds. Invisible playing
  alone, since every track punches on the same grid; it does offset the
  MIDI clock against the music by that much. Measured and understood.
- The MIDI clock's tick interval is a truncating divide, so it runs
  slightly fast and accumulates against external gear over a long session.
  Both of these are next.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-07-27

The resample release — heads mode learns to print.

### Added
- The BOUNCE: in heads mode, hold an EMPTY track (~0.4 s) and the whole
  heads performance — positions, directions, per-head levels and mutes,
  the window, reversed or not — prints into it as ONE loop. It is not a
  recording: it's an offline render of exactly one audible cycle, so the
  seam is perfect by construction and the print lands IN PHASE with its
  source. The destination fast-blinks while it prints (a few seconds),
  then heads mode exits by itself with the new loop playing — you hear
  exactly what you just built. Print it, re-head it, print again: the
  resample spiral. (Live filter sweeps and tape speed are NOT baked in —
  they stay live tools on top of the print, like on any track.)
- Heads on ANY track: the triple-tap engages on the lowest playing
  unmuted track, and holding any LOADED track inside heads mode makes IT
  the tape (your head positions and directions carry over).
- You can see what's printable: a head with nothing underneath chases at
  a faint ghost intensity — faint = empty = a bounce target; full bright
  = loaded = a source you can grab.

### Changed
- Heads-mode mutes are performance state now: entering heads un-mutes all
  four heads (a muted track no longer sits silent in the canon), taps
  mute freely without ever touching the song's saved mutes, and the
  original mutes return exactly on exit.
- The muted-track ghost glow is a touch fainter in dim mode, so muted
  reads clearly darker than playing; full-brightness mode is unchanged.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed
- Pocket-proof power-on: waking from full power-off used to skip the hold
  check entirely — one accidental press in a bag switched the device fully
  on ("playing breakbeats in your pants", community report) and drained
  the battery. Every power-on now requires the same deliberate hold,
  lengthened to a stock-like ~1.5 s, with the side row filling as a
  countdown (the power-off animation, mirrored). Releasing early drops
  straight back to off; an accidental blip costs milliseconds and shows
  one dim LED for an instant. Power-off is unchanged (~2.5 s, countdown).
  Watchdog/crash recovery still boots directly, preserving forensics.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-07-26

The fader release — while FUNCTION is held, the four faders become a
performance surface. Everything here is session-state: songs on flash are
never touched, and letting go of FUNCTION always returns the faders to
volume duty without a jump.

### Added
- Heads mode scrub: hold FUNCTION and the faders move the four heads'
  positions on the loop, live — all four, track 1's own phase included.
  Grabbing jumps the head to the fader (it's a scrub); each step is
  declicked per head; the light chase follows.
- Heads mode reverse: double-tap a track and that head plays BACKWARD
  (the gesture was free — delete is blocked in heads mode). Double-tap
  again for forward; everything resets forward at heads entry; the light
  chase walks backward with the audio.
- Window faders: hold FUNCTION outside heads mode — fader 1 = window
  START, fader 2 = END, free fractions of the chop period at any width
  (down to a ~1/128 sliver), not just the stepped halves; fader 3 =
  SHIFT (width and direction kept). CROSS start past end and the window
  plays in REVERSE. Any chop button returns to the stepped window.
- DJ filter: FUNCTION + fader 4 (outside heads mode) — center = clean,
  slide down = low-pass sweep (to ~80 Hz), slide up = high-pass sweep
  (to ~4.5 kHz). Sits on the master mix, so it colors everything,
  including the live input. Latches where you leave it; neutral at
  power-on.
- Chop length glide: holding FUNCTION+FWD/RWD now auto-repeats the
  halve/double — steady declicked steps, full range in ~2.3 s.

### Fixed
- FUNCTION+PLAY triple-tap (the heads toggle) registers reliably: fast
  taps no longer merge, unhurried triples still count, and a missed
  triple can no longer flip the fixed/variable loop mode. The double-tap
  1.0x snap now waits out the triple window (~0.6 s), so a completed
  triple never touches the tape speed — heads engage at the speed you
  are playing.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added
- Heads mode: with track 1 playing, hold FUNCTION and TRIPLE-tap PLAY —
  tracks 2-4 stop playing their own loops and become three extra tape heads
  on track 1's loop, offset by quarters of its cycle. One loop in four
  phases, like a canon: each head has its own fader and mute, the four
  lights chase in sequence, and chop moves all four heads at once. Playback
  only — recording and delete are blocked while it's on (taps still mute);
  triple-tap again to exit and tracks 2-4 return untouched. Switching songs
  or powering off also exits (like speed, mutes and chop, every song opens
  as itself). The second tap of the triple is still the 1.0x snap, so heads
  always enter at native speed.

### Changed
- Songs without a grid: each playing light now pulses when ITS OWN loop
  wraps (chop-aware) instead of all four pulsing one shared beat —
  different-length loops paint their polyrhythm on the panel; long loops
  flash ~2 beats at each wrap. Gridded songs keep the shared grid pulse
  and metronome chase — except in heads mode, where the canon chase takes
  over on gridded songs too.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added
- Hold FUNCTION+Vol to glide the chop window: the shift auto-repeats after
  ~450 ms, accelerating from ~250 ms to ~125 ms per step, each step
  declicked — a tape-scrub across the loop on the existing buttons.

### Fixed
- Chop edits no longer click: a short declick envelope (dip ~5 ms, recover
  ~27 ms) masks the window-jump discontinuity — steps, halve/double and
  double-click reset alike.
- The power-off pop is gone: the mix fades over ~85 ms, then both output
  stages are soft-muted (CS42L42 headphone mute, TAS2505 Class-D mute)
  before power-down.

### Notes
- Recording follows tape speed (since 2.0): a slowed tape stores
  proportionally less bandwidth — classic tape behavior. Snap to exactly
  1.0x (FUNCTION+PLAY double-tap) before critical takes for full fidelity.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-23

The big one — 2.0 is everything the development line built, merged into the
official repo as one release.

### Added
- 16 songs in 4 banks of 4 (was 4). FUNCTION+Track N jumps to bank N; the
  same track again (still held) steps through the bank. Song row: solid =
  position, blinking = bank.
- Per-song memory: loops, tape speed/pitch, chop window, loop-length mode
  and mutes all persist across power-off.
- 8-minute takes: 643-beat regions (8:00 at 1.0x; one beat = 35,840
  samples; 44 MB per track, 76.4% of the 7,553,024-block card, ~912 MB
  spare). Recording follows tape speed — a half-speed tape holds ~16 min.
- Loop chop: FUNCTION+FWD/RWD halves/doubles the playing window,
  FUNCTION+Vol shifts it, rocker double-click resets. Per song, persistent.
- Tapped grids: 4+ FUNCTION-taps set tempo (50-200 BPM) and downbeat;
  lights become a metronome; grid persists per song. Quantized capture
  (instant first punch, bar-line overdub punch-in with count-in, stops
  snapped to whole beats), tap-to-beatmatch (0.5-1.5x vinyl-style) with
  FUNCTION+PLAY double-tap 1.0x snap, MIDI clock out on the sync jack.
- Dim-by-default lights (merged from chattock's dim build, tuned two-row)
  with FUNCTION+PLAY 5 s hold OR a hidden #settings page switch for full
  brightness; ghost glow distinguishes muted-with-content from empty.
- Charge-standby battery gauge (smoothed, hysteresis); powering off while
  plugged lands in the gauge instead of going dark.
- Transfer page 2.0: 16-song aware, Download all, speed-compensated WAV
  round-trip, serves 1.x and 2.0 devices from the same URL.
- In-repo board definition — the repo builds with stock Zephyr v4.3.1 +
  SDK 0.17.4, one west command.

### Fixed
- Headphone/line output pad (-19 dB) removed — full-scale output.
- Loop seams: stops act on the press; release latency no longer smears
  loop lengths.
- Export pitch: sub-80-BPM songs no longer export fast/high.
- Torn-index: the song index writes magic-last, surviving power cuts.
- A press that stops a take can no longer silently re-arm a re-record.
- Double-tap delete on gridded songs: a development-line trim of the
  gridded re-record hold (120 ms) sat inside the real 50-150 ms tap band
  and could turn a delete tap into an armed re-record — the hold is the
  full 180 ms everywhere again (empty tracks keep the instant arm).

### BREAKING — export your songs before flashing
- New on-flash layout (magic 'S816'). First boot reformats loop storage:
  on your CURRENT firmware, export everything (Download all), flash, then
  re-upload on the same page. Grids survive; tape speeds reset to 1.0x
  (songs still sound the same — uploads are rate-compensated). Max take
  for 1.x owners changes ~10 min -> 8:00 (slow the tape for more).

## [1.2.4] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- Powering off while plugged into USB now lands in the charging gauge —
  the same standby you get plugging in an off device — instead of going
  dark until a replug. (SYSTEM_OFF with VBUS already high has no wake
  edge, so the firmware soft-resets into charge-standby instead.)
  Unplugging from that gauge powers fully off; power-off on battery is
  unchanged.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- The brightness setting now covers every light the device shows. The
  charging gauge, the power-ON sweep and the FUNCTION-hold power-off
  sequence all ran dim regardless of the saved mode, because they lit
  before the index holding the setting had been read. The index reader now
  starts ahead of standby and the saved mode is applied before each of
  those moments (including button wake-ups, which skip standby entirely).

## [1.2.2] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- The on-device brightness toggle returns, without spending a new gesture:
  hold FUNCTION+PLAY through 5 seconds and dim/full flips on the spot (no
  release needed). The transfer page's #settings switch remains; both
  persist.

### Changed
- The fixed/variable mode toggle now fires on RELEASE of the FUNCTION+PLAY
  chord (350 ms tap-filter up to 5 s, either finger first — previously only
  a PLAY-first release fired it, so the natural both-together release
  silently aborted). Release detection is ladder-debounced so a stray dip
  can't restart the 5 s clock.
- Dim levels tuned: track row 52 us (a hair below the classic 60); the
  song/status row runs its own 66 us window (slightly brighter side lights).

## [1.2.1] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- Battery gauge flicker while charging near a level boundary: the display
  took one raw ADC sample per pass with no smoothing or hysteresis, so ADC
  noise plus charger ripple could flip the level many times a second and
  strobe the boundary LED between off and blinking. The reading is now
  averaged over ~10 passes and the level only moves once the average clears
  a threshold by a +/-18-count margin.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- Launch-quantized mutes: on gridded songs, mute/unmute waits for the next
  bar line (fast-blinking while pending; tap again to cancel) — layer moves
  land exactly on the "1", Ableton-style. Ungridded songs mute instantly.
- Tap-to-beatmatch: a tap run over existing loops retunes the tape to the
  tapped tempo (clamped 0.5-1.5x, vinyl-style pitch) and restarts the loops
  on the tapped downbeat at the next bar — tempo and phase matched in one
  gesture. Works from a tapped grid or a first-take-derived tempo.
- FUNCTION + double-tap PLAY now snaps the tape to exactly 1.0x / 80 BPM —
  "tap to match, double-tap to come home". (This replaces the dim toggle.)
- Transfer page: hidden settings panel (open with #settings) with a full-LED-
  brightness switch for direct sunlight; the firmware adopts the setting at
  transfer commit. The device itself is always-dim now.
- Tapped grid (phase 1): tap FUNCTION 4+ times to give a song a tempo grid —
  first tap = downbeat, lights become a metronome, the bank light blinks on
  the beat, MIDI clock locks to the tapped tempo (runs while stopped). Tempo
  persists per song in a self-validating flash-block-2 extension (no format
  break; the transfer page is unaffected). Hold FUNCTION after tapping to
  clear. Groundwork for quantized capture (phase 2).

- Quantized capture on gridded songs: the first take punches in the moment
  you arm and places the downbeat; stops snap to the last whole beat (no
  silence in loops, ever; near-miss stops run on to the line with a
  double-blink cue); overdubs count in (fast-blinking armed light) and punch
  exactly on the next bar line, lengths snapping to shared beat multiples.
  Songs without a grid record exactly as before.

### Fixed
- A long, firm stop press could silently re-arm a re-record that overwrote
  the loop it had just captured (the stop fires at press-down since the
  perfect-loop work, so the finger is still on the button while the take
  flushes). A press that stops a take is now spent — arming requires a
  fresh press. Latent since v1.0.0 for long stop presses with live input.

### Changed
- Navigation: FUNCTION-tap no longer advances songs. Hold FUNCTION and press
  a track to jump to its bank; press the same track again to step through
  that bank's songs. FN-taps are the tap-tempo surface (1-3 taps are inert).
- Re-record hold on gridded songs trimmed 180 ms -> 120 ms (the punch waits
  for the grid anyway; the shorter hold only shrinks the felt constant).
- Stopped transport: tracks with content now read solid instead of freezing
  dark like an empty track.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added
- Ghost LED class: a muted track that has content glows faintly (one frame in
  five of the dim window), so dark still means empty and a glance shows what
  is sleeping under a song. Community request.
- Per-song mute memory: a song's muted tracks come back muted — across song
  switches, power-off and transfers. A fresh take, a delete or a site upload
  un-mutes that track. Stored in spare index bits: same SE16, no reformat.
  Note: builds older than 1.1.0 misread the loop-mode stamp on songs with
  saved mutes — flash forward only.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- 16 song slots in 4 banks (up from 4 songs). FUNCTION cycles banks;
  FUNCTION + Track N jumps straight to bank N (power-off-safe). Song shown
  with two lights: position solid, bank blinking 2 Hz.
- Loop regions up to ~5 minutes at 1.0x.
- Per-song memory: tape speed (upstream) is now joined by the chop window
  and the fixed/variable loop mode. Mode is two-layer: a global preference
  plus a per-song stamp - empty songs inherit the global, the first take
  stamps the song, delete-to-empty unstamps.
- Global loop chop: FUNCTION+FWD/RWD halves/doubles the playback window,
  FUNCTION+Vol shifts it, rocker double-click resets. Non-destructive.
- Perfect-loop capture: the first-take stop fires on the press-commit edge
  (~24 ms constant) instead of at release (+50-165 ms variable), and the
  constant is backdated out of the take. (A beat-snap experiment lives on
  the experiments/beat-snap branch.)
- Always-dim LEDs via soft-PWM with a zero-latency ISR; FUNCTION+PLAY
  double-tap toggles dim/full, persisted. Credit: Technics (also the
  upstream author).
- Battery gauge while charging: 1-4 LEDs from pack voltage, top LED blinks
  until the charger reports done; thresholds anchored to a measured full
  reading.
- Reconstructed board definition - the repo now builds with stock Zephyr
  v4.3.1 (see README build notes).
- Transfer page: 16-song / 2-block index support.

### Fixed
- Export pitch bug (upstream, affects all firmwares): exported WAVs are now
  stamped at the song's heard rate and uploads are inverse-compensated, so
  files sound like the device in both directions.
- Torn-index hazard: 2-block index writes are magic-last, so an interrupted
  save can never half-apply.
- Headphone max volume: removed the -19 dB codec mixer pad (~1/9th of stock
  loudness); the digital chain already soft-limits before the codec.

### Changed
- Index format is SE16 (2 blocks). FORMAT BREAK from stock SE4A: the first
  boot reformats loop storage - export songs first. Between SE16 builds,
  flashing preserves songs. Stock firmware is restorable anytime via the
  Track 1 + Track 4 bootloader.

### Known deviations
- USB VID enumerates 0x2fe3 (Zephyr v4.3.1 lacks SAMPLE_USBD_VID plumbing);
  cosmetic.
- CONFIG_PM / CONFIG_STACK_SENTINEL from prj.conf are inert on mainline
  v4.3.1 (MPU stack guard active; idle is plain WFI).
